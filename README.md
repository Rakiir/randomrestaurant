# randomrestaurant  
An Angular web app to solve the "I don't know, where do you want to eat" issue my girlfriend and I have.  
  
To modify this app for your own uses:  
+ Go to _/src/app/restaurants.ts_ and edit the lists of restaurants with your desired restaurants.  
+ Go to _/src/app/top-bar/top-bar.component.ts_ and change the name of the _locName1_ and _locName2_ variables to the names of your desired cities/locations you'd like to use.  
  
  I hosted this project on Stackblitz.com to make accessing it from anywhere easy for me and my girlfriend.
